# AI4MRM
**AI4MRM** is a set of services thought for the improvement of creation and management of medical records in the hospital environment.
It is a must to manage/manipulate hospital information digitally. But right now, specifically in the medical field due to informatic advances, there is a gap between research and implementation of such technologies. Our proposal is to start to bridge that gap, bringing a set of implementations to the field of medical records.
The AI4MRM system is a subscription-based service that wants to update the experience for the medical record creation and management. Our audience is primarily private hospitals and hospitals located in South American countries which donâ€™t use an inter-hospital network for medical record management.
